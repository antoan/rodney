## Face Recognition
The pan_tilt node was written in C++, this node will be written in Python. This partly because it gives us examples of ROS nodes written in two different languages but also because I'm going to write the node around some existing Python code.

The package is available in the GitHub Repository https://github.com/phopley/face_recognition. This package not only contains the code for the ROS node but also two standalone Python scripts that are used to train system for the faces you wish to recognise.
